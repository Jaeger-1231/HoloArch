# Dependencies

The source of truth is [`packaging/dependencies.json`](../packaging/dependencies.json).
Release tooling generates PKGBUILD dependency fields from this inventory. `defaultInstall`
selects the full installation profile; optional authorization and vendor GPU drivers are never implicit.

Runtime-only dependencies are assigned in package functions, so this repository builds and
tests independently of other Clavis repositories. CI installs only build, check and CI entries.
